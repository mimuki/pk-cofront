# pk-cofront
This is a tool that combines members of your system, so you can "proxy as both of them". It also generates an avatar for you to use, in case you want to.

## How to use
1. Download test.py, and put it in a folder somewhere.
2. On windows, run `py -3 -m pip install -U pluralkit`, otherwise run `python3 -m pip install -U pluralkit`
3. Inside the folder you put it in earlier, run `python3 test.py`, or otherwise run it however you run python scripts
4. It will generate a config.py for you. Edit that config.py to add your token (run `pk;token` in Discord to get it) 
5. Run `python3 test.py` again, and follow the prompts 
    1. If it doesn't work, cry, because I am not good at python. (feel free to make an issue though, i might be able to fix it)
7. To use the avatar it generates, set it via Pluralkit

## TODO:
(no promises on if I ever do these, but they are cool ideas)
- [ ] Don't let you combine the same member multiple times
- [ ] More convinient editing of the combining character 
- [ ] Autofill more fields like pronouns, colour, etc
- [ ] More options for image generation
- [ ] Clean up extra images when finished
- [ ] Find an image host that is good and lets me set avatar for you???
